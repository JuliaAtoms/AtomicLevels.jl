# Term symbols

AtomicLevels provides types and methods to work and determine term symbols. The ["Term
symbol"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_symbol) and ["Angular momentum
coupling"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum_coupling) Wikipedia articles give a good basic
overview of the terminology.

For term symbols in LS coupling, AtomicLevels provides the [`Term`](@ref) type.

```@docs
Term
```

The [`Term`](@ref) objects can also be constructed with the [`@T_str`](@ref) string macro.

```@docs
@T_str
```

The [`terms`](@ref) function can be used to generate all possible term symbols. In the case
of relativistic orbitals, the term symbols are simply the valid ``J`` values, represented
with the `HalfInteger` type.

## Term multiplicity and intermediate terms

For subshells starting with `dÂ³`, the possible terms may occur more
than once (multiplicity higher than one), corresponding to different
physical states. These arise from different sequences of coupling the
``w`` equivalent electrons of the same ``\ell``, and are distinguished
using a _seniority number_, which the [`IntermediateTerm`](@ref) type
implements.

AtomicLevels.jl uses the algorithm presented in

- _Alternative mathematical technique to determine LS spectral terms_
  by Xu Renjun and Dai Zhenwen, published in JPhysB, 2006.

to compute the multiplicity of individual subshells, beyond the
trivial cases of a single electron or a filled subshell.

In the following, ``S'=2S\in\mathbb{Z}`` and
``M_S'=2M_S\in\mathbb{Z}``, as in the original article.

## Term couplings

To generate the possible [`terms`](@ref) of a configuration, all the
possible terms of the individual subshells, have to be coupled
together to form the final terms; this is done from
left-to-right. When generating all possible [`CSFs`](@ref CSFs) from a
configuration, it is also necessary to find the intermediate couplings
of the individual subshells.
